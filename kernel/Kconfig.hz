# Timer Interrupt Frequency Configuration

choice
	prompt "Timer frequency"
	default HZ_250
	help
	 Allows the configuration of the timer frequency. It is customary
	 to have the timer interrupt run at 1000 Hz but 100 Hz may be more
	 beneficial for servers and NUMA systems that do not need to have
	 a fast response for user interaction and that may experience bus
	 contention and cacheline bounces as a result of timer interrupts.
	 Note that the timer interrupt occurs on each processor in an SMP
	 environment leading to NR_CPUS * HZ number of timer interrupts
	 per second.


	config HZ_100
		bool "100 HZ"
	help
	  100 Hz is a typical choice for servers, SMP and NUMA systems
	  with lots of processors that may show reduced performance if
	  too many timer interrupts are occurring.

	config HZ_250
		bool "250 HZ"
	help
	 250 Hz is a good compromise choice allowing server performance
	 while also showing good interactive responsiveness even
	 on SMP and NUMA systems. If you are going to be using NTSC video
	 or multimedia, selected 300Hz instead.

	config HZ_300
		bool "300 HZ"
	help
	 300 Hz is a good compromise choice allowing server performance
	 while also showing good interactive responsiveness even
	 on SMP and NUMA systems and exactly dividing by both PAL and
	 NTSC frame rates for video and multimedia work.

	config HZ_1000
		bool "1000 HZ"
	help
	 1000 Hz is the preferred choice for desktop systems and other
	 systems requiring fast interactive responses to events.

	config HZ_10
		bool "10 HZ"
	depends on MCST && E2K	# only under CONFIG_MCST && CONFIG_E2K
	help
	 10 Hz is a typical choice for simulator e2k arch.
	 Such a low HZ due to the low frequency of simulated hardware.

	config HZ_20
		bool "20 HZ"
	depends on MCST		# only under CONFIG_MCST
	help
	 20 Hz is a typical choice for simulator e2k/x86 arch.
	 It is the minimum HZ value for x86 to do not cause an overflow
	 of 16 bits 'PIT_LATCH' (PIT timer counter).
	 Such a low HZ due to the low frequency of simulated hardware.
