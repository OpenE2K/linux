	  It is possible for the kernel to log important events to a trace
	  facility. Doing so enables the use of the generated traces in order
	  to reconstruct the dynamic behavior of the kernel, and hence the
	  whole system.

	  The tracing process contains 4 parts :
	      1) The logging of events by key parts of the kernel.
	      2) The tracer that keeps the events in a data buffer (uses
	         relay).
	      3) A trace daemon that interacts with the tracer and is
	         notified every time there is a certain quantity of data to
	         read from the tracer.
	      4) A trace event data decoder that reads the accumulated data
	         and formats it in a human-readable format.

	  If you say Y, the first component will be built into the kernel.
