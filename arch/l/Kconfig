	  Elbrus Programmable Interrupt Controller supports multiprocessor
	  systems with up to 1024 cores and uses 10 bit vectors for
	  masked interrupts.
	  Controller implements hardware support for interrupt virtualization.
	  Consists of CEPIC (per core), PREPIC (per processor) and IOEPIC.

config SERIAL_PRINTK
	bool "dump_printk() support"
	depends on E2K || E90S
	default y
	select L_EARLY_PRINTK
	help
	  dump_printk() outputs directly to serial port bypassing all
	  buffers and locks. It is useful for hardware debugging.

	  Only two devices are supported currently: ns16550 (== 8550)
	  and l_zilog (== am85c30).

	  On simulator dump_printk() also outputs to LMS console.

	  Kernel parameter "boot_printk_all" is added. If set, dump_print()
	  will be used everywhere instead of printk().

config NVRAM_PANIC

	   panic output is saved into nvram. It can be extracted from

config PIC
	bool "PIC support"
	depends on E2K
	default n
	help
	  An PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller) is an old-style
	  interrupt controllers. If you say Y here kernel will use PIC
	  only while initialization to service erly time interrupts.
	  Later after initialization SMP mode, local and IO APICs
	  kernel will switch all interrupts from PIC to IO-APIC
	  If you say N (recomended) PIC is not used never and not even
	  initialized.

config L_X86_64
	def_bool y
	depends on L_LOCAL_APIC
	---help---
	  This option helps compiling code copied from arch/x86/kernel/apic
	  with minimal changes to code (renamed X86_64 -> L_X86_64).
	  Hopefully it will be easier to update the code this way.

config L_UP_APIC
	bool
	depends on !SMP
	default E2K || E90S
	---help---
	  A local APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) is an
	  integrated interrupt controller in the CPU. If you have a single-CPU
	  system which has a processor with a local APIC, you can say Y here to
	  enable and use it. If you say Y here even though your machine doesn't
	  have a local APIC, then the kernel will still run with no slowdown at
	  all. The local APIC supports CPU-generated self-interrupts (timer,
	  performance counters), and the NMI watchdog which detects hard
	  lockups.

	  If you have a system with several CPUs, you do not need to say Y
	  here: the local APIC will be used automatically.

config L_UP_IOAPIC
	bool
	depends on L_UP_APIC
	default E2K || E90S
	---help---
	  An IO-APIC (I/O Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) is an
	  SMP-capable replacement for PC-style interrupt controllers. Most
	  SMP systems and many recent uniprocessor systems have one.

	  If you have a single-CPU system with an IO-APIC, you can say Y here
	  to use it. If you say Y here even though your machine doesn't have
	  an IO-APIC, then the kernel will still run with no slowdown at all.

	  If you say yes to this option, embedded flash (S25FL064A or similar) driver will
	  be switched from SPIDEV to SPI-NOR.
	  Both can be used by flashrom userspace tool, but SPI-NOR/MTD also requires mtd-utils
